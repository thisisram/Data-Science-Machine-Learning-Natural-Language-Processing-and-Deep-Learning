4789,however it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at won't work.,0
4790,it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs i guess and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?,0

4835,Verified accts for all is an OK idea but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways which I've talked about in the past.,0
4836,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.,0
4837,however twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients.,0
4838,the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.,0
4839,add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update natch).,0
4840,does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.,0
4841,phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV) but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse.,0
4842,in short there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic not perfect.,0
